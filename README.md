I have created a Udemy-style online course platform using HTML and CSS. The site features a clean, user-friendly layout with a responsive design. It includes key sections such as:

Home Page: Highlights featured courses and popular categories.

Course Listings: Displays a grid of available courses with images, titles, instructors, and ratings.

Course Details Page: Offers detailed information about each course, including curriculum, instructor bio, and enrollment options.

Navigation Bar: Provides easy access to main sections like Home, Courses, About, and Contact.

Responsive Design: The website is optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The project focuses on frontend structure and design, showcasing my skills in HTML5 and CSS3.
